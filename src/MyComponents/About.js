            From notepads to digital to-do list apps, the world has changed drastically. Fully-enabled, powerful to-do list apps not only offer quality assistance for task management but improve your productivity too.
            
            There’re lots of to-do list apps available. Some of these apps are free, some are fee-based, but the primary objective of all of them is to offer classic task scheduling assistance to help you manage and finish the tasks with ease and on time.
            
            Yes, many apps offer many of the same features but are these features useful for you? Do all these apps offer the level of assistance you need to keep your life on track?
            
            Before getting you the list of the best to-do list apps, let’s get to know how to choose the best one for yourself:
            
            Statistics suggest that there are 17 million to-do list software applications and websites available but not all of them will be useful for you.
            
            So, where do you begin to choose the best to do list app for your needs?
            
            First, define your method of task management:
            
            How do you assign your tasks to the group?
            What is your task completion and notification process?
            Do you allow others to add additional details or like to keep the task details short?
            How do you keep a record of your tasks?
            Answer these questions first in order to determine the best task management method for you.
            
            Almost every app offers a simple to-do list feature, like organizing a grocery list.
            
            However, if you want to add subtasks, attachments as well as additional details to existing tasks, which is typical for teams working collaboratively on a project, you need a more powerful project management platform.
            
            Below is the list of some of the best to-do list apps to let you organize tasks with ease and improve productivity.
            
            From simple task scheduling to detailed task management, all these apps offer everything you need for better tasks management.
